CIFAR10 CNN MODEL TRAINER

---

This code is written to train a CNN model based on the VGG Model A on the CIFAR10 dataset.
It was trained in Google Colab, using a connection to Google Drive for
long term storage of model checkpoints and code files, since the Google Colab environment usually
deletes all files after 24h.

To test and run the code locally, simply call colab_trainer_new.py using
>> python3 colab_trainer_new.py

This will run the model locally creating a folder called "local_test" containing model checkpoints and
training history.
